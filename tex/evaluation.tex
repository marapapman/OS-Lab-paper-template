\section{Evaluation}\label{section5}
To evaluate \toolname, we focus on answering following research questions



\textbf{RQ 1}: Does \toolname improve the aspect \blank{} for the technical requirement? \explain{Add more if you have more than one aspects}

%Process based Precision，recall，F1，alarm rate

\textbf{RQ 2}: Does \toolname address the technical problem?

\textbf{RQ 3}: Do the insights valid emprically?


\textbf{RQ 4}: Is \toolname useful in read production environment? \explain{optional, if you are lucky, you will have this}.

\subsection{Experiment Environment and Datasets}
The hardware platform of our experiment environment is \blank{}. The OS is \blank{}. The software environment is \blank{}. 

We use \blank{} datasets because \blank{}. 

We use \blank{} as baselines because \blank{}


\subsection{RQ 1: Better Satisfy the Requirement in Aspect 1}
We evaluate whether \toolname better satisfies the aspect \blank{} of the technical requirement by measuring the metric \blank{}. We use this metric because \blank{many other papers use it or other solid reasons. }  To measure the metric  \blank{}, we do \blank{}. Our measurement is solid because \blank{}. \explain{sometimes the reasons for solid are obvious, then you may omit the discisson}.

We report the result in Table/Figure X. Particularly, \toolname is XX\% better than the baselines. This result proves that \toolname can better satisfy the requirement. 


\subsection{RQ 2: Does \toolname Address the Technical Problem}
We evaluate whether \toolname address the technical problem \blank{} by measuring the metric \blank{}. We use this metric because \blank{many other papers use it or other solid reasons. }  To measure the metric  \blank{}, we do \blank{}. Our measurement is solid because \blank{}. \explain{sometimes the reasons for solid are obvious, then you may omit the discisson}.

We report the result in Table/Figure X. Particularly, \blank{}. This result proves that \toolname address the technical problem.

\subsection{RQ 3: Do the Insights Valid}
We evaluate whether the insights are valud by measuring the metrics \blank{}. We use this metric because \blank{many other papers use it or other solid reasons. }  To measure the metric  \blank{}, we do \blank{}. Our measurement is solid because \blank{}. \explain{sometimes the reasons for solid are obvious, then you may omit the discisson}.

We report the result in Table/Figure X. Particularly, \blank{}. This result proves that \toolname address the technical problem.

\section{Threats to Validity}
\explain{This is for SE papers only. Discuss potential threats to your evaluation protocal that may lead to biased measurement and how you address these threats. see:https://mydissertationeditor.com/threats-to-validity/}
